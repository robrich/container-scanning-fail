Container Scanning Fail Example
===============================

This is an example of using GitHub Actions to create an automated build that fails a security audit at the time of writing.

Look at `.github/workflows/docker.yaml` for the integration of Anchore container scanning.

Look to https://robrich.org/slides/continuous-security-by-design/#/ for the slides for this talk.
